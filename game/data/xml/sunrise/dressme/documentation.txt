Payment options system for transmog engine

There are some custom payment ids example:
PC_BANG_POINTS = -100;
FAME = -300;

// This option will consume the needed item only the first time
// by default all items are payOnce="false"
payOnce="true"

Example:
<price id="57" count="50" payOnce="true" />
transmog engine will consume 50 items with id 57 only one time
