Here you can complete Foundation Items.<br>
These uncommon items are brought into being by a power than goes beyond mere chance. Dwarves say that it is the blessing of Maphr.<br>
That perfect craftsmanship is beyond the Human race's capacity.<br>
Bring <font color="LEVEL">Mammon's Varnish Enhancer, which is sold by the Merchant of Mammon</font>. Then you can transform the item here into something accessible to mortals.<br>
Be sure to select a helmet among the rare items that provides you with a useful power. Don't worry if you make the wrong choice, though. You will have another chance to make a selection.<br>
