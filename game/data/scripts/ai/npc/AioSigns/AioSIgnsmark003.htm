The cost is high if you wish to keep the <font color="LEVEL">ancient Adena</font> from corroding. You must pay 4 times the normal cost. Also, you can only buy in bundles of 500,000 ancient Adena.<br>
To make sure the ancient currency is spread widely, we have limited the amount that an individual can buy per day.<br>
